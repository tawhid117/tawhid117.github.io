<b>Regional energy system based on solar, wind and storage for constant and dynamic loads.</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>
The work was done in the department of Electrical Energy Technologies – Sustainable Energy Concepts under supervision Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Stefan Krauter and Dipl.-Ing. Stefan Balluff.

<p>
The aim of this thesis work was to find an energy solution comprised of renewable energy (wind, solar) and energy storage to supply different types of loads. 
Here, we exploited both wind and solar resources in a small region of Paderborn and tried to find the best combination that can provide the load sufficiently. 
</p>

<p>
We used the data from the measurement devices that are installed in the University of Paderborn. By varying heights of the wind turbines, we simulated different scenarios for different loads over different time periods and noted their effects on energy balance. We found most suitable solutions for diverse situations i.e. for constant/dynamic load and summer/winter season.
</p>

<p>
The procedure we developed can be used to conduct feasibility study for a generation plant combining both PV modules and wind turbines in this region. A practical example would be a standalone household run by wind and solar power with or without grid integration.

<b>Robot arm operation using pre-recorded motion controls.</b><br>
</p>

<p>
The concept is, the operator manually controls the robot arm with a joy pad to perform one task. This movement including all the important intermediate points are recorded, so that they can be automatically executed later.
</p>
<p>
KDL dynamixel library was used to record the angular positions of the seven servro motors installed at the robot arm. A graphical user interface was also created as a connecting bridge between the robot hardware and database. It was used to record one complete task and also to load a from a list of previously recorded tasks from database for repeatative operation.

<p><h3><font color="red"><b>Project-3:</b></font></h3> 
<b>Cognitive system in virtual reality - modeling and simulaiton.</b><br>
</p>
<p>
This was done as a part of the course. The ideas was to represent different cognitive response via any object/animal.
I choose ant and tried to sketch a lifecycle of it depending on food source, physical energy and diffrent status like, 
working, searching for food, taking food, death etc.
