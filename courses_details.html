<b>Regional energy system based on solar, wind and storage for constant and dynamic loads.</b>
<br>
</p>
<p>
The work was done in the department of Electrical Energy Technologies – Sustainable Energy Concepts under supervision Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Stefan Krauter and Dipl.-Ing. Stefan Balluff.
</p>

<p>
The aim of this thesis work was to find an energy solution comprised of renewable energy (wind, solar) and energy storage to supply different types of loads. 
With the increasing emphasis on penetration of renewables in total generating capacity, it is important to harvest as much potential as possible from the available resources. In this thesis, we exploited both wind and solar resources in a small region of Paderborn and tried to find the best combination that can provide the load sufficiently. Our task was to find solutions for both dynamic load which varies randomly and constant load which is same over the whole period. 
</p>

<p>
We used the data from the measurement devices that are installed in the University of Paderborn. So, we had data from different devices at different resolutions which we had to resample in a way that they stay on the same time steps with the same time interval. Then we calculated the energy balance for each time step. We tried to find the minimum installation setup of solar panels, wind turbines and battery storage which can supply the load without interruption. We started with the calculation of a 3 days period and found the minimum setup. Based on that, we modified the generation and storage capacity that can successfully supply load for different spans i.e. one week, one month, six months, and finally one year.
</p>

<p>
By varying heights of the wind turbines, we simulated different scenarios for different loads over different time periods and noted their effects on energy balance. We found most suitable solutions for diverse situations i.e. for constant/dynamic load and summer/winter season.
The procedure we developed can be used to conduct feasibility study for a generation plant combining both PV modules and wind turbines in this region. A practical example would be a standalone household run by wind and solar power with or without grid integration.

<b>Robot arm operation using pre-recorded motion controls.</b><br>

<p>
The concept is, the operator manually controls the robot arm to perform one task. This movement is recorded at the same time in a way that it can be automatically executed later.
</p>
<p>
The operator controls the robot with the joy pad. In addition to the target point, other in between points must also be stored. The reason is to avoid collision with any existing obstacle. In order to record the points, the current position of the robot arm is requested by the graphical user interface. An additional widget is required to be created and integrated with the existing operator interface. Using this, a motion sequence, containing the individual movement steps, can be generated in the GUI. Next, this motion sequence is required to be saved for playback. The GUI acts as a connecting bridge between the robot hardware and database. So, the motion sequence is sent to a database to be stored. The database is built as an independent node which is able to perform different operations as requested by the client (GUI). The database stores the motion sequence in computer hard drive. So, the saved points remain available even after restarting the whole system.
</p>
<p>
Next portion is to repeat the task which is already recorded and stored in the database. The operator can choose from a list of available sequences from the database. The chosen sequence is loaded from the database to GUI and sent to the hardware interface for execution. Then, the whole motion sequence, consisting of starting pose, intermediate poses and goal pose, is executed automatically by the robot arm. So, the concept can be divided into three areas:<br>Motion Sequecen Database<br>Graphical User Interface (GUI)<br>Hardware Interface
