I belong to the generation that had radio sterio, walkman and iPad - all together in their teens! I was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh in
in 1985 and lived there till 2013. All my memories from childhood to adult, from primary to bachelor, marriage and job - 
everything relates me to this 2000 year old city.

Lately, the city is embracing more color at the expense of green, which hurts me a lot!

But one thing I like most is the foods and availability. You just cannot walk for 10 minutes without seeing a food shop, may it be
a restaurant or tea stall or road side temporary cart! My being fan of experimenting foods is just the outcome of just being
intriguied by the unlimited options that this city of life offered.
