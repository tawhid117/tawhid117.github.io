	<b>Hi ... </b>I am an electrical engineer, with my bachelor from Bangladesh and masters from Germany where I am staying right now. I have started this site 
	to put a little bit of me on the web as well as to see how it works ... :)
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	I belong to the generation that had radio sterio, walkman and iPod - all together in their teens! I was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh in
	in 1985 and lived there till 2013. All my memories from childhood to adult, from primary school to bachelor and job - 
	everything relates me to this 2000 year old city.

	<p>
	Lately, the city is embracing more color at the expense of green, which hurts me a lot! 
	</p>
	<br<br>
	<p>
	But one thing I like most is the foods and availability. You just cannot walk for 10 minutes without seeing a food shop, may it be
	a restaurant or tea stall or road side temporary cart! My being fan of experimenting foods is just the outcome of just being
	intriguied by the unlimited options that this city of life offered.
